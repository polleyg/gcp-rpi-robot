# rpi-robot
Raspberry-Pi

This is an extension to a project for dojocon 2017 (http://coderdojowa.org.au/dojocon/). I'm (Archie) currently creating a client and a sever for this robot using java so you can remotely control. You might be asking yourself "Hang on a second you can acomplish the same thing using VNC", well that is true but VNC is unreliable and well, slow. On the other hand this sever is made for RPIBot and is faster and more reliable.

Right now this server is just a WIP and shouldn't be merged with the main branch.

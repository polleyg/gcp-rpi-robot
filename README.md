# rpi-robot
Raspberry-Pi

This is a project for dojocon 2017 (http://coderdojowa.org.au/dojocon/), 2 ninjas are working on this, Michelle and Archie are writing the software and Graham is mentoring. We are making a raspberry pi robot that uses machine learning and the google cloud API to move around and take pictures of objects and then uses text to speech software to describe the object. To make the robot we are going to use the GoPiGo base model and build ontop of that with a raspberry pi.

There are some Python modules needed. Simply run this. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
